# Warcry: Clans and Kingdoms

## Introduction

Warcry: Clans and Kingdoms is a bright and cartoony, open source, real-time fantasy strategy game about the endless wars between the orcish clans and human kingdoms, heavily influenced by Warcraft: Orcs and Humans. The game is set in the procedurally generated rich forests, dark dungeons and bubbling swamps of Atser, featuring all the delicate elements of military strategy, with the unique goal to reform the very basis of a genre by revisiting the game that founded it.
