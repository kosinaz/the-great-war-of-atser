# Warcry: Clans and Kingdoms

## Introduction

Warcry: Clans and Kingdoms is a bright and cartoony, open source, real-time fantasy strategy game about the endless wars between the orcish clans and human kingdoms, heavily influenced by Warcraft: Orcs and Humans. The game is set in the procedurally generated rich forests, dark dungeons and bubbling swamps of Atser, featuring all the delicate elements of military strategy, with the unique goal to reform the very basis of a genre by revisiting the game that founded it.

## Description

*You look down at the crystal ball and run your hands across it. Behind the swirling surface, the town of Wimborne soon appears, and you suddenly stop your finger on Sir Owain and his troops.*

*"My lord?" you hear his voice in your head. The corporal's figure quickly fades away in the fog as you shift your focus to the nearby mountains.*

*"Yes, my lord!" says your noble servant and quickly orders his men to explore the area near the mines once again.*

*You wanted to extend the patrols to this region. You were about to build a scout tower here, but because of the raiding parties of that wretched lord Berthelot, you forgot about this little mining town in the south. When the reports came in about the lack of ore income, you already knew you made a huge mistake.*

*You stare at the abandoned roads through Sir Owain's eyes looking for the loaded carts heading towards the little town, but you see no one. Then the first broken cart appears on the horizon, and soon the second one behind it. As the corporal orders his men to take a closer look at them, you catch sight of a dead body. One of his legs is far away from his torso, and his head is gone. You have never seen something like this before, but you don't have time to think about it for long.*

*Suddenly a series of inarticulate warcries breaks the silence of the valley as a band of green-skinned monsters storms your men.*

*"We are under attack!"*

In Warcry: Clans and Kingdoms you either play as a lord of your chosen human kingdom who has to save his land from the invading orcish hordes, or as a master of your chosen orcish clan who has to conquer the human world. Discover the lush forests, dark dungeons and bubbling swamps of Atser. Utilize your villages, build farms and mines, establish outposts, train armies, send them on patrols, research powerful magic spells, build a castle, defend your people, and finally find your enemies and slay them all.

Start over and you will find an entirely new procedurally generated world with new friends and foes waiting just for you to explore and conquer it again.
